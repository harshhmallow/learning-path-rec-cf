# learning-path-recommender-cf
A simple recommendation system to suggest courses for students/learners. It uses Collaborative Filtering (CF), which works by analyzing user behavior (such as courses viewed, enrolled, completed) and identifying patterns among similar users.
Based on these patterns, the system recommends the next best courses or subjects for a learner, helping them follow an effective and customized learning journey.
